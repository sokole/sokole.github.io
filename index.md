## Research
My research applies metacommunity theory, using computer-based simulations, to test hypotheses about what factors structure biodiversity across various types of freshwater ecosystems. Current projects focus on macroinvertebrates in streams in North America and algal communities in freshwater habitats in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. I am interested in promoting FAIR data principles in ecology and the environmental sciences, partly because I am involved in various synthesis projects focused on spatial and temporal trends in biodiversity that make use of FAIR data. Through these efforts, we are developing workflows intended to be reproducible and available for future groups to use to conduct synthesis work.
